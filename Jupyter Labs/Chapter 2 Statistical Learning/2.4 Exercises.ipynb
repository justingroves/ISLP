    "**Answer**:  With an extremely large sample size and a small number of predictors, a flexible model will perform better than an inflexible model.

    "model performance is based upon minimizing the variance and bias terms of $\\hat{f}$. With an extremely large sample size, the variance of $\\hat{f}$ will be minimized no matter what model flexibility we assume. Flexible models often suffer due to high variance, but due to the extremely large sample size this will be mitigated. However, given a small number of predictors $p$, the bias term will be minimized when we use a flexible model as opposed to an inflexible model. This is because a flexible model that does not assume a linear relationship among the predictors introduces less assumptions of the relationship between the predictors, thereby lowering the bias of $\\hat{f}$."

    "**Answer:** With an extremely large number of predictors and small number of observations, then an inflexible model will perform better. Referencing equation $(1)$ above, model performance is dependent upon the variance and bias of $\\hat{f}$. With a small number of observations, flexible models will suffer from high variance dependent upon the training set. While their bias will be small, this will be offset by the very high variance. In comparison, using an inflexible model (such as assuming a linear relationship among the predictors) will result in less variance dependent upon the training set due to the rigid loss functions of the inflexible model. Their higher bias will be offset by the greatly reduced variance, resulting in an overall improved model performance. This will avoid the common pitfall of overfitting, which is commen when using very flexible models with small sample sizes."

    "**Answer:** In the case that the relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear, the model with the best performance would be a flexible model. As inflexible models often assume a rigid linear relationship between the predictors (such as linear regression), an inflexible model would not capture the true relationship between the predictors. While an inflexible model $\\hat{f}$ following equation $(1)$ would have a low bias term, due to the relationship between the predictors not able to be captured by an inflexible model the variance of $\\hat{f}$ (depending upon the training data) would be very high, resulting in poor performance (i.e., underfitting). Using a flexible model would introduce low bias and be better at capturing the relationship among the predictors using the training data, resulting in a lower variance term as well. Note though, that if the sample size was small, a simpler flexible model would be preferable to avoid overfitting."

    "**Answer:** In the case that the variance of the error terms is extremely high, then an inflexible model will have the best performance. The reason is that a flexible model will be extremely sensitive to the erradic noise present in the sample data. Following equation $(1)$, a flexible model is very sensitive to the sample data and the variance of $\\hat{f}$ will greatly increase due to the randomness of the noise present from the distribution of $\\epsilon$. To mitigate overfitting the noise of the model, an inflexible model's rigid structure (such as linear regression) will ignore extreme variation caused by the distribution of $\\epsilon$, resulting in overall better model performance.

In this case, $n=20$ and $p=14$.

We recommend a flexible model due to the high likelihood that the relationship among the predictors and response is highly non-linear.
